Code runs with Python 3.8.10 and requires some libraries such as pyspark (v3.2.1), seaborn, matplotlib.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Churn prediction is always focus topic for streaming services like Sparkify. Predicting customer behavior and trying to keep them in the service will improve company's profit and service quality. 

Our aim is to analyze user logs and try to figure out non-satisfied customers. Because of the huge amount of data, we'll use Spark to analyze data and create machine learning pipeline.
